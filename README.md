#### MVP 
1. use postman to observe that the airtable api is working
2. create react app and install anything else needed like axios
3. test render data from airtable as proof information can be displayed
4. have options to go to shopping cart,home,reviews, and inventory 
5. have inventory display show categories of different kind of items
6. pressing a category should give items of that category. example (pressing mouses, should show any mouses avaliable).
7. item should show infomation like its price, brief description and the ability to put it in a shopping cart.
8. items that are in the shopping cart should also have the ability to be removed from said shopping cart
9. pressing review should take you to a form which then should let you give it a select item,give it a rating and a place to input text along with a submit button as well as edit and delete your review.
10. pressing shopping should also take you directly to your shopping cart.
11. style with flexbox and add media queries.

#### PostMVP

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: I think my greatest strength is to be able to plan my process throughly with pseudocode. This helps me organize my thoughts and included everything i know i'll need so i dont get distracted adding features at the last minute. As well as learning being able to search online and my own notes for what i need when i encounter problems regarding error messages. Alot of what we did to implementing certain features happened in class so i feel confident in implementing certain features like routes and forms.

### Weaknesses: the rating system i had in mind might be a roadblock for me because i havent decided if i should settle doing ratings for numbers 1-5 or stars 1-5. Another roadblock i think i'll have trouble with is getting certain information to carry over in the shopping cart as well as implementing a shopping cart thats as close to one thats use on sites like amazon.

### Opportunities: utlizing my notes from the audubon hw, music and recipe app should give me an idea of how i should structure this website. figuring out how to implement thereact shopping cart npm features might help alot but wont use unless i decided its necessary to use it. I can also ask for advice during TA hours and use issue tickets when a big problem arise.

### Threats:# My greatest weakness is taking too much time implementing something whether its fixing errors or a new feature then only realizing later i didnt make real progress with my work. In situations where if im stuck i shoould ask for assistance i rather learn to fix it myself than have someone do it for me. Its a habit im trying to break away from.
